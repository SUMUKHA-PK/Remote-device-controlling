# Remote-device-controlling

Goal : <br/>

* To make a cross platform application that enables remote device control. <br/>
* This includes file extraction, making music play from the local hard drives or opening certain webpages. <br/>
* This will be done while ensuring secure consent from both ends of the devices. <br/>
* Extra functionality addition that will make the complicated nature of devices easier. <br/>

Working : <br/>

* Working of the application requires the devices to be connected to a network. We will start out by working with LANs and then extend to the internet.
* Application from any device will be able to trigger any other device on the same network to perform any of the tasks supported.
* Conflict resolution will be based on protocols that will be defined later based on convenience.
